The new Lab or last part is to creat a filesystem
On Its learning you can find  the parts to use in  the lab
-          Shell
-          Test
-          BlockDev
-          MemBlock
-          Filesystem
those are made in  “JAVA”.
And the part “Anvisningar = Instructions” can you read   here.  Instructions to  create a Filesystem
 
Next Lecture Tomorrow Göran is in the lab and can answer questions
I am not available Wendnes day and Thursday
But on Friday   can I have lecture 
what time ??
 
I read mail

Instructions to creat a filesystem. 

You should make a file system that handles a
secondary memory simulated as a byte array in java.
 
The file system must be a hierarchical tree structure of UNIX.
You should make a shell that supports the following commands
(most of the normal UNIX commands).
File name is also listed on the UNIX way and you should clear
the name of the type aaa / bbb / cc ....., also. And .. 

format - builds an empty system ( "Formatting the disc") 
quit - leave the driving 
save - save the system as a standard UNIX file 
read - restore a file from a UNIX file 

create - creates a file (add text to extra blank line) 
cat - print contents of a file 
ls - lists contents of a directory 
copy - copy a file 
append - add to end of a file
rename - change the name of the file 
mkdir - create new empty directory 
cd - change current directory 
pwd - prints the name of the current directory (print working directory) 
rm - remove a file 


items. 
copy file1 dir1/dir2/file2 
rm file1 
rm dir1/dir2/file2
